--------------------

Let's get started
-----------------

In order to install and use FlashKit, you at least need python 3.7 or above.

Run the following commands to retrieve and install the FlashKit library::

    cd <path to install location>
    git clone git@github.com:GWU-CFD/FlashKit.git
    pip install -e FlashKit

The '-e' option in the installation line allows us to update the local git repository with
the ``git pull`` command, such as when there is a new release of FlashKit, without reinstalling 
the repository each and every time we would like to update the repository.

If you have difficulty cloning the repository, make sure you both have access to FlashKit and
that your ssh key settings are properly configured with github for the machine you are using.
