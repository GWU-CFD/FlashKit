Interface
=========

The following pages provide both the command line and python interface specification for FlashKit.

Changes to this specification will not be made without changes to the FlashKit version numbering.
Specifically, the FlashKit library uses the `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/>`_ convention to
communication changes to the interface specification and indicate changes in observable behavior such as
bug fixes.
